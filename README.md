# Bonjour ! 👋

I’m a software developper since I graduated from Supinfo in 2007. At the time I coded in Java using Struts MVC with Hibernate. It was Firefox 1.4 era and the beginning of JQuery ^^.

I did learn my job on a J2EE project. So placing the code at the correct place mattered since the beginning of my career.

I use a lot of “DD” suffixed philosophies in my day to day work :

- TDD :fire:
- DDD :fire:
- BDD :fire:

I’m an adept of *clean code* and *best practices*. I truly believe in the *Software Craftsmanship manifesto*. I believe even more in the Agile values.

I’ve been trained on Scrum and I got *Scrum Master Certification* altough I’m not a “Scrum by the book” guy. I see agile frameworks like toolboxes to solve a team problems.

I try to go to craft oriented conferences as often as possible. I go to NCrafts and Domain Driven Design also.

# Where am I ?

I'm working for [Arolla](https://www.arolla.fr). I work as a consultant and instructor for *TDD* and *Working on legacy code*.
